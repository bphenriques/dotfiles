[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repository containing my [Nix](https://nixos.org/) configurations to manage my machines. A declarative and _more_ reproducible way to set working environments.

----

# Quick start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** This is a personal configuration. I am no expert, however 
> I hope that this helps you! For more help on Nix(OS) seek out [the NixOS discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org).
> If you are new to dotfiles in general, use a bare git solution to start with and built it from there. Make the tools work for you rather than the other way around.

1. Ensure [`nix`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/installing-binary.html) is installed.

2. Bootstrap:

   ```sh
   $ nix-shell --packages git --command "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bphenriques/dotfiles/master/bin/bootstrap.sh)"
   ```

3. Apply:
   ```sh
   $ "$HOME"/.dotfiles/bin/sync.sh
   ```

4. Import the GPG Key using `gpg --import`. You may need to restart.
   
5. Reboot!

# Secrets

[sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix) for critical secrets and `age`+`git-filter` (`smudge` `clean`) for non-critical sensitive information required in Nix evaluation time.

To setup `git-filter`:
```shell
$ ./bin/git-secret-filter.sh init
```

As detailed in `.gitattributes`, only `*.age.nix` are affected. My public keys under `.sops.yaml` and the corresponding private keys under `"$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops/age/keys.txt"`.
