# Description

Personal workspace installer. Saw many, took inspiration of some and
got confused by others. In the end I decided to learn by doing one myself
with the following guidelines:
* Cross-platform to keep workflow consistency between different OS.
* Sensible settings and avoid being too couple to my own settings.
* Simplify installation as possible which means:
    * Using `stow` to manage dotfiles seamlessly.
    * Automate `Brewfile` installation.
    * Unfortunately some programs are not installed with just `brew install <module>` followed by `stow <module>`, therefore had to get creative.
* Idempotenty so the installer can be run as many times as possible.

# Installation

In order to install modules:
```sh
$ ./installer.sh [MODULE 1] [MODULE 2] [MODULE N]
```

After this:
1. Setup sensitive information.
2. You may have to manually open the UI applications in order to set them up.

# Development

## Requirements

* [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)

## Commands

Check the `README.md` file for the available commands.

## Tmux

* Made sure that the default `#!Z` indicators are present.
* Added `Î¨` as indicator that the panels in a window have their input syncronized.
* Some tweaks to the theme.
