# Description

My personal workfpsace installer. Took inspiration of some and did my own gist.

In order to install modules:
```sh
$ ./installer.sh [MODULE 1] [MODULE 2] [MODULE N]
```

After this:
1. Setup sensitive information.
2. You may have to manually open the UI applications in order to set them up.

# Development

## Requirements

* [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)

## Commands

Check the `Makefile` file for the available commands.
